##Tasks ##

Problem: #1 What’s the change in stock’s price over time? 
          Expectation/To Do: DataFrame and Graph( Month Vs stock Price) 
          
  #2 What is the change in volume in the year 2017: 
  Expectation: Graph
  Note: We shopuld do this 2-D color coded graph for each stock. So, toal 5 graphs for this part
   
  #3 What was the daily return average of a stock?
   Exp: For yhoofinance the command for this is: `df.pct_change()`. 
        Don't know for morningstar. Will have ot see the documentation.
        
  #3 What was the moving average(MA)of various stocks?
    Exp:  Need to create one col for MA for 10, 20, 50 days.
         AAPL[column_name] = AAPL['Adj Close'].rolling(window=ma,center=False).mean() # We will use soemthing like this. Don't know for MS(Mrning Star)
         Plots/subplosts for this.
         
  #4 What was the daily return average of a stock?    
    Exp:  AAPL['Daily Return'] = AAPL['Adj Close'].pct_change() # from Yahoofinance. check morningstar
        sns.distplot(AAPL['Daily Return'].dropna(),bins=100,color='red')
        AAPL['Daily Return'].plot(figsize=(14,5),legend=True,linestyle='--',marker='o')
  
  #5 What was the correlation between daily returns of different stocks?
    Exp: Create/add 'Adj Close' column 
     e.g.: close_df = DataReader(tech_list,'yahoo',start,end)['Adj Close']
           create df with date as index and stock-names as columnss
           Graphs:
           We should try the following graphs:
           sns.pairplot(rets_df.dropna())
          sns.jointplot('GOOG','AAPL',rets_df,kind='scatter') # seaborn libraries
          sns.corrplot(rets_df.dropna(),annot=True)
  
  # 6 How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?
     Exp:  We will figure it out latter.
